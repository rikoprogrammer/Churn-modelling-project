# Churn-modelling-project
This project seeks to implement a deep learning model to predict customer churn rate.\
Companies always love retaining customers especially if those customers are high valued customers aka HVC.\
Churn reffers to a situation where customers leave one company/business to the other owing to various reasons eg poor service delivery,poor customer service etc\
It's therefore of paramount importance for a company to know in advance which customers are likely to churn so that proper remedial measures can be undertaken.\
In this project we implement an artificial neural network that can aid in predicting which customers are likey to churn.\
ANNs are very powerful in the arena of deep learning owing to the fact that they mimmick the human brain in understanding correlations in the given dataset.
